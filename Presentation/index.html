        <h1>Learning about C</h1>
        <h2>Topics that will be covered:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A little History</li>
          <li>What is C used for?</li>
          <li>Basic Information</li>
          <li>What is a compiler</li>
          <li>Getting started</li>
        </ul>

          <section><h1>Basic History</h1></section>
          <section> <p>C was created in 1972 by a man named Dennis Ritchie.</p></section>
          <section><p>C was made because the B language was not able to handle the new and upcoming challenges.</p></section>
          <section><p>B was a slow language and could not take advantages of the PDP-11 computer</p></section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section><h1>Uses for C</h1></section>
          <section>
            <p>C either completely made, or largly made these operating systems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
              <li>Linux</li>
              <li>Mac</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>C also is used to write these database:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Oracle</li>
              <li>MySQL</li>
              <li>PostgreSQL</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section><p>C is also really good at handling embedded systems like smart TV's and lots of "Internet of Things" (IoT)</p></section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section><h1>General Information</h1></section>
          <section><p>C provides low level access to memory.</p></section>
          <section><p>C is considered a Generic language. Meaning it is not only used for a few things. it is good at many different types of tasks</p></section>
          <section>
            <p>C's paradigms</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Imperative - A programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state</li>
              <li>Procedural - A programming paradigm that describes, step by step, exactly the procedure that should be followed to solve a specific problem</li>
              <li>C does not have built in OOP support</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section><p>Well writen C code can be ran on many platforms and/or operating systems with little to no change to the source code</p></section>
          <section><p>C is a compiled language</p></section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section><h1>What is a compiler and how does it work</h1></section>
          <section><p>A compiler takes code written from a language and translates it into a language that the computer's proccesser can understand.</p></section>
          <section><p>unlike an interpriter which scans the document line by line, a compiler scans the whole document before the program is run</p></section>
          <section><p>Compilers generate error messages only after scanning the whole program. Which can make debugging comparatively hard.</p></section>
          <section><p>compiling is generally faster than interpreting</p></section>
