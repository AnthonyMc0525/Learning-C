"There was once a man named %s", variableName
%s is for string variables
%d is for an integer number variable
%f is for a double variable type (if you're using this within scanf() it would be %lf instead.)


//data types (sizes are in bytes)

Number types{
int - whole number
  signed int - size: 2 range: -32,768 to 32767
  unsigned int - size: 2 range: 0 to 65535
  signed short int - size: 1 range: -128 to 127
  unsigned short int - size:1 range: 0 to 255
  signed long int - size: 4 range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 
  unsigned long int - size: 4 range 0 to 4,294,967,295
Floating point type - stores real numbers
  float - size: 4 range: 3.4E-38 to 3.4E+38
  double - size: 8 range: 1.7E-308 to 1.7E+308
  long double - size: 10 range: 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932

}

Character types{
  char - one character only as a string
    signed char - size: 1 range: -128 to 127
    unsigned char - size: 1 range: 0 to 255
  //to have multiple characters in a string to the bellow line
  char Variablename[] - creates a string of characters
}

Void type{
  void - means no value. // ususally used to specify the type of functions which return nothing
}

printf

Format specifiers{
  %d - print an int
  %s - print a string
  %f - print a decimal number
  %c - print a single character
}

any math operation you do with an int and a floating point number will always return a floating point number
5 / 4 returns 1 //division between two ints will return an int value even if there is a remainder

functions c gives you {
  pow(2, 3) == 2^3
  sqrt(36) == 6
  ceil() - rounds up
  floor() - rounds down
}

write a comment with /* */ this works for multiline comments

to make a variable a constant(cant be changed) you have to put const before the variable type. like this: const int NUM = 3; the names of variables that are constants are by good convention all uppercase

// the bottom two methods get input from the user in different ways
scanf() - allows the user to input into the program
you have to put what type of data you want from the user like this: scanf("%d", &variable_name)

fgets(variable_name, "how many chars can be input", where to get info from(usually stdin)); - used to get strings as input from the user.

//to create an array:
first tell C what type of data you want to store: int, or char
then the name: myArray
then put []
int myArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
